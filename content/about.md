<p align="center">Hello, I'm John Humphries</p>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC to a large, quintessential Carolina-border family. I grew up around lots of BBQ, Baptists, and boy bands; the latter thanks to my older sister. My childhood brain was subject to intense curiosity about anything and everything. Thankfully this has been refined over time to my faith, music, and being a total tech nerd. If I'm not spending time with my wonder wife and two dogs, you'll find me reading, playing guitar, or annoying said wife by attempting to write code through the double digit hours of the evening. All that said, welcome to my blog! It's my pleasure to share some time on this earth with you.
